# BridgeTheGap

Empowering Expressions — One Sign at a Time.

# 🤟 Sign to Speech - AI-Based Assistive Communication Tool

## 📘 Project Overview
A real-time AI-powered system that recognizes **hand gestures from sign language** and converts them into **text and speech**, enabling seamless communication for individuals with speech and hearing impairments. The project specifically aims to cater to **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** recognition and bridge the accessibility gap in India.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
People with speech or hearing disabilities face constant communication barriers, especially in non-inclusive environments. Current solutions are limited, expensive, human-dependent, or not tailored to Indian Sign Language. Our solution offers an **affordable, real-time, and AI-driven sign-to-speech converter** to make communication smoother, faster, and more inclusive.

---

## 🚀 Goals & Objectives
- Enable **gesture-based communication** using computer vision.
- Convert **signs to text and then into audible speech**.
- Make it **real-time, lightweight, and deployable** on web/mobile platforms.
- Focus on **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** for regional relevance.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Indian Sign Language (ISL) Fingerspelling Dataset**
- build a **custom gesture dataset** using webcam
- Possible augmentation for accuracy improvement

---
---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
- Reverse system: **Speech to Sign using avatars**
- Multilingual speech output (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
- Facial expression analysis for emotion detection
- Mobile app version
- Context-aware NLP for intelligent responses [NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, process, and generate human language (text or speech). It acts as a bridge between human communication (natural language) and computer understanding (machine language).]
- Integration with assistive IoT devices (e.g., smart boards, gloves, wristbands)

---

## 🏆 Unique Value Proposition
- **Tailored for Indian Sign Language**
- **Lightweight & Real-Time**
- **Low-cost, accessible solution**
- Can be integrated into schools, hospitals, banks, railway stations, etc.
